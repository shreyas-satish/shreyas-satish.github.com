          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Quick intro</h4>

<ul>
  <li>I’m working on an education company called <a href="https://ownpath.xyz/">ownpath</a>, to explore an alternative model for higher education. It is intended to be more accessible, affordable, and designed around lifelong learning.</li>
  <li>Previously, I’ve helped organize <a href="https://hillhacks.in/">hillhacks</a>, written software for a <a href="https://hasjob.co">job board</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/boxoffice">event ticketing system</a>, and a <a href="http://bcity.in/">city information system</a>.</li>
  <li>If you have an interesting project in mind that you’d like to collaborate on, please write to me at <a href="mailto:shreyas.satish@gmail.com">shreyas.satish@gmail.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="font-weight-bold">hillhacks</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hillhacks.in/">hillhacks</a> is an annual, volunteer-run event in the Himalayas, that brings together artists, architects, activists, technologists and people of other stripes, to make and break things together and to learn from each other.</li>
  <li>I’ve been a volunteer with hillhacks since the 0th edition in 2014, and I helped curate the content for the main programme in <a href="https://attic.hillhacks.in/2014/summary">2014</a>, <a href="https://attic.hillhacks.in/2014/summary">2015</a> and <a href="https://hillhacks.in/sessions/">2018</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="mb-5"></div>

<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Boxoffice</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/boxoffice">Boxoffice</a> is <a href="https://hasgeek.com/">HasGeek’s</a> open source event ticketing system.</li>
  <li>I was the lead developer for the project from its inception in Jan 2016 to April 2018, and I worked on this along with <a href="https://twitter.com/jackerhack">Kiran Jonnalagadda</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vidya_ramki">Vidya Ramakrishnan</a> and <a href="https://karthikbalakrishnan.com/">Karthik Balakrishnan</a>. Since 2016, it’s been the primary ticketing system for all of HasGeek’s events.</li>
  <li>Why it was built:
    <ul>
      <li>Before Boxoffice, HasGeek used other ticketing solutions and ran into some interesting issues. For instance, we uncovered a fairly serious security vulnerability in one of them and also found that they were spamming our customers.</li>
      <li>This prompted us to build our own ticketing system since it would also let us own the user experience for our customers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Side note: If you’re hosting a technical event, I recommend getting in touch with the nice folks at HasGeek if they can help you use Boxoffice!</li>
</ul>

  <li>Along with Kiran, I helped setup the backend email infrastructure which involved a mix of <a href="https://github.com/atech/postal">postal</a> (to receive email) and a custom Python/Flask application to send email.</li>

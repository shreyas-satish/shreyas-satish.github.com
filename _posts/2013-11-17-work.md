<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Quick intro</h4>

* I'm working on an education company called [ownpath](https://ownpath.xyz/), to explore an alternative model for higher education. It is intended to be more accessible, affordable, and designed around lifelong learning.
* Previously, I've helped organize [hillhacks](https://hillhacks.in/), written software for a [job board](https://hasjob.co), an [event ticketing system](https://github.com/hasgeek/boxoffice), and a [city information system](http://bcity.in/). 
* If you have an interesting project in mind that you'd like to collaborate on, please write to me at <shreyas.satish@gmail.com>.

<h4 class="font-weight-bold">hillhacks</h4>

* [hillhacks](https://hillhacks.in/) is an annual, volunteer-run event in the Himalayas, that brings together artists, architects, activists, technologists and people of other stripes, to make and break things together and to learn from each other.
* I've been a volunteer with hillhacks since the 0th edition in 2014, and I helped curate the content for the main programme in [2014](https://attic.hillhacks.in/2014/summary), [2015](https://attic.hillhacks.in/2014/summary) and [2018](https://hillhacks.in/sessions/).

<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Boxoffice</h4>

* [Boxoffice](https://github.com/hasgeek/boxoffice) is [HasGeek's](https://hasgeek.com/) open source event ticketing system.
* I was the lead developer for the project from its inception in Jan 2016 to April 2018, and I worked on this along with [Kiran Jonnalagadda](https://twitter.com/jackerhack), [Vidya Ramakrishnan](https://twitter.com/vidya_ramki) and [Karthik Balakrishnan](https://karthikbalakrishnan.com/). Since 2016, it's been the primary ticketing system for all of HasGeek's events.
* Why it was built:
  - Before Boxoffice, HasGeek used other ticketing solutions and ran into some interesting issues. For instance, we uncovered a fairly serious security vulnerability in one of them and also found that they were spamming our customers.
  - This prompted us to build our own ticketing system since it would also let us own the user experience for our customers.
* Side note: If you're hosting a technical event, I recommend getting in touch with the nice folks at HasGeek if they can help you use Boxoffice!

<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Pricing at HasGeek</h4>

* I was responsible for crafting and implementing HasGeek's pricing strategy for conference tickets from April 2016 to April 2018. I was fortunate to be working with and guided by Kiran and [Zainab Bawa](https://twitter.com/zainabbawa) on this.
* My work involved understanding the value proposition for HasGeek's conference attendees, studying competition and previous purchasing patterns in order to arrive at a value-based pricing plan for each conference.

<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Hasjob</h4>
* [Hasjob](https://hasjob.co) is HasGeek's [open source](https://github.com/hasgeek/hasjob) job board. My main contribution was helping architect and develop the part that lets users filter job posts and view the filtered job posts instantly.

<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Speak For Me</h4>

* [Speak For Me](https://www.speakforme.in/mp/?lang=en) is a volunteer driven effort to help citizens in India reach out to their elected representatives. It began with the goal of motivating citizens in India to voice their concerns with the Indian government's coercive attempts to get citizens to link their national identitification number (Aadhaar) to all of their private service providers (phone, bank, internet etc).
* Along with Kiran, I helped setup the backend email infrastructure which involved a mix of [postal](https://github.com/atech/postal) (to receive email) and a custom Python/Flask application to send email.
